# Project-1-Exploratory-Analysis and Presenting-Insights-

Exploratory Analysis and Presenting Insights to help a supermarket, 2Market, understand more about their customers, their purchasing behaviour, and potential relationships between advertising and purchases. 

SCENARIO

Working as a data analyst for 2Market, a global supermarket that sells products online and in-store, to help them understand their customer purchase behaviour. 

In particular, 2Market wants to understand:

- The demographics of their customers 
- Which advertising channels seem to be the most effective
- Which products seem to sell the best and if that varies based on demographic
  
To support 2Market, I’ll:

1. Complete my analysis and create a dashboard: I’ll analyse the data and create a dashboard that includes key metrics to inform decision-making (such as the average revenue from each marketing channel.)
2. Complete a report: I'll write a report explaining my approach and any insights discovered.
3. Presentation: I’ll communicate insights to stakeholders in a recorded presentation.
